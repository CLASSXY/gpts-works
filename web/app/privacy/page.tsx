          <strong>Privacy Policy for GPTs Works</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Last Updated: 2023/11/18</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Introduction</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We offers the GPTs Works Chrome extension (the "Extension"), designed
          to provide users with recommendations for GPTs applications based on
          their geographical location. This Privacy Policy outlines our
          practices concerning the collection, use, and sharing of location data
          through the Extension.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Data Collection</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Location Information</strong>: We collect precise location
            information (e.g., GPS coordinates) from users' devices when they
            use the Extension. This collection occurs only with the user's
            explicit consent and is essential for the functionality of the
            Extension.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Use of Data</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Recommendations</strong>: The collected location data is
            used exclusively to recommend GPTs applications that are relevant to
            the user's current location.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Improvements</strong>: We may also use this data in an
            aggregated and anonymized form to analyze usage patterns and improve
            our Extension.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Data Sharing</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>No Third-Party Sharing</strong>: We do not share users'
            location information with third parties for marketing or advertising
            purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Service Providers</strong>: Location data may be shared with
            service providers solely for the purpose of supporting the
            Extension's functionality, under strict confidentiality agreements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal Obligations</strong>: We may disclose location
            information if required by law or in response to a valid legal
            process.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>User Consent and Control</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Users are asked to provide explicit consent for location data
            collection upon installing the Extension or accessing its
            location-based features.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users can withdraw consent and stop the collection of location
            information at any time through the Extension settings or their
            device settings.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Data Security</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We implement robust security measures to protect the collected
            location data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or
            destruction.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will post any
            privacy policy changes on this page and encourage users to review
            our policy periodically.
